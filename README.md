# ontario_cv19_opendata_plot
A very basic Jupyter Notebook that plots Ontario COVID-19 open data, specifically for Ottawa.

This is my second Jupyter Notebook so please don't consider this anywhere near completed code.  It's more of a learning exercise in reading data and making charts.

Note that you can't read Jupyter Notebooks within GitHub in any meaningful way.
You'll need a Jupyter environment like [Google Colaboratory](https://colab.research.google.com/), Anaconda or Microsoft Visual Studio Code to actually see and run the code.
